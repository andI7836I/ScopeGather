## RIPE Database

The [RIPE Database](https://www.ripe.net/) is a publicly accessible database maintained by the Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC). It contains information related to IP address allocations, ASN assignments, domain objects, and other network-related data within the RIPE NCC service region.

By querying the RIPE Database, you can obtain valuable insights about IP address ownership, network infrastructure, and contact details associated with specific IP addresses or ASNs.

To make the most of ripedb, visit the [RIPE Database website](https://www.ripe.net/) and explore the available search options and documentation provided by RIPE NCC.
